<h2 align="left">Hi 👋, I'm Abdul-Khaliq Solaiman</h2>
<h4 align="left">
I love exploring new technologies, experimenting with code, and building projects that make a real impact. From web development to data science, I enjoy learning and applying new skills in practical ways. I also have freelancing experience, which has taught me how to turn ideas into working solutions and continuously grow as a developer. Every day, I strive to challenge myself, learn something new, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.
